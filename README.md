# EveCherryPrevent

Bored about mining drama in your corp/alliance ?

This tool will help you find those people who are only doing cherry picking !
You can doing mining ladder board, and adapt your mining rules with it !

## How it work ?

  it compute reward from extracted value you picked from client Eve api. it also compute an ore distribution from average ore quantity in anomaly belt.
  default cherry ORE value 'Arkonor', 'Bistot', 'Gneiss', 'Crokite'.
  default dirty ORE 'Dark Ochre', 'Spodumain', 'Mercoxit'.
  
  So, if you extract belt average Ore quantity your reward will be 0 (Belt cleaner), if you extract too many cherry ore your reward will be < 0 (Bad miner, cherry picker detected :D), and if you extracte only dirty ore your reward will be > 0 (Good miner !)
